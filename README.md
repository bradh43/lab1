<p>This app includes a hidden feature. If you click on the shopping cart image, it will use location services to get your current coordinates. It takes theses coordinates and uses the Geolocator to get the current state. The app then looks up the state and finds the average sales tax and fills out the sales tax field in the app for you.</p>
